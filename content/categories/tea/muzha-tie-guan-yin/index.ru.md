Самый необычный, и мой любимый ТГ на данный момент. 

Карамель и мед во вкусе. Огонь не чрезмерный.

This is the third plantation that grows Wu Yi varietal in our connection, and surprisingly it is owned by Chang family, the Muzha family that is known for its lineage of Tie Guan Yin processing. 

The famous history of Muzha Tie Guan Yin began in 1919, the year that the Chang Family brought the Tie Guan Yin varietal to Taiwan to cultivate.  In other words, Tie Guan Yin has a relatively long history among Taiwanese teas, and today the offspring of the original Chang Family is still making the most authentic and classical Tie Guan Yin for the pickiest tea drinker. 

Classical Tie Guan Yin is made from 100% Hong Xin Wai Wei Tao Varietal (紅心歪尾桃)  and has to be processed in a certain way which involves numerous stages of rolling and delicate roasting that will take approximately 20 hours across 2 days to complete the process. However, this Tie Guan Yin was not processed with Hong Xin Wai Wei Tao, but an even older varietal - Wu Yi (武夷). 

Wu Yi varietal is one of the earliest varietals in Taiwan's tea history, and Hong Xin Wai Wei Tao was way behind its path. Began planted along the Tamsui River in the 19th century, Wu Yi eventually was grown all the way to the upper stream of the river. Muzha is mostly famous for its Hong Xin Wai Wei Tao varietal, but it also has Wu Yi varietal as well. Ironically, the Hong Xin Wai Wei Tao Tie Guan Yin was sent for local competition, and this competition teas are no longer processed in the traditional way anymore, which means we either had to find other material, or we simply gave up.

Fortunately, Mr. Chang decided to use his Wu Yi varietal to process the Tie Guan Yin. At  this point the meaning of "Tie Guan Yin" simply imply the "process" was how Muzha process the Tie Guan Yin tea. During the supervision, Mr. Chang's wife revealed the way we told them was how their grandfather processed their teas back then, which is no longer being used today because the judge of the competition simply don't understand it. 

Once the draft tea was completed, it was sent to our roasting master Mr. Zhuang for charcoal roasting. Mr. Zhuang exclaimed that this is an exceptional Wu Yi according to his experience and was surprised how we obtained the tea. After his careful treatment and our care for each processing stage, we are proud to say that this is the most unique Wu Yi experience you will have in the current market.
