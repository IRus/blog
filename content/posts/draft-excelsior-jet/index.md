Weâ€™ve published native binaries of Kotlin 1.2.60 compiler (built with Excelsior JET compilers https://www.excelsiorjet.com/) to https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v1.2.60
If you need to use standalone compiler and faster startup to build small files or scripts, that could be useful. No build system integration is planned for now. Please share your experience if you try them.
