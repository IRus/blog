JavaScript creator and Mozilla co-founder Brendan Eich just released version 0.11.6 of [Brave](https://www.brave.com/) browser.

It's amazing how easy it's today to make the browser: just take Node.js, Electron and a small team... Boom, you have a modern browser with the latest web technologies.

Brave has good privacy defaults: https everywhere, tracking protection and ad blocking. Also, you can block scripts in few clicks, it's really funny since Brendan is JavaScript creator. For sure I'll keep this browser and maybe will use it from time to time.

Hope Firefox will apply this defaults too.
